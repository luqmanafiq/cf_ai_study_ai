# AI Prompts Used in Development

This document contains all AI prompts used during the development of CF AI Study Assistant, as required by the Cloudflare assignment.

---

## Initial Research & Planning

### Prompt 1: Understanding Cloudflare Agents SDK
```
I need to build an AI application for a Cloudflare assignment. The requirements are:
- LLM (recommend Llama 3.3 on Workers AI)
- Workflow/coordination (recommend Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects)  
- User input via chat or voice
- Memory or state

I provided these links:
- https://agents.cloudflare.com
- https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents

Can you fetch the official Cloudflare Agents SDK documentation and explain the key patterns I should follow?
```

**Response**: Retrieved official documentation showing `AIChatAgent`, `createDataStreamResponse`, `agentContext.run()`, tool confirmation patterns, and proper React hooks usage.

---

### Prompt 2: Project Architecture Design
```
Based on the official Cloudflare Agents SDK patterns, design a study assistant application that:
- Uses AIChatAgent as the base class
- Implements tool calling with human-in-the-loop confirmations
- Tracks study progress with SQL database
- Has callable methods for frontend interactions
- Follows the agents-starter template patterns exactly
```

**Response**: Generated architecture with StudyAgent extending AIChatAgent, proper state management, SQL integration, and tool system.

## Backend Development

### Prompt 3: StudyAgent Implementation
```
Create src/server.ts implementing StudyAgent that:
- Extends AIChatAgent from 'agents'
- Uses createDataStreamResponse for streaming
- Wraps operations in agentContext.run()
- Implements onStart() for initialization
- Implements onChatMessage() properly
- Uses processToolCalls for tool confirmations
- Has SQL table for study sessions
- Includes @callable() methods for frontend
```

**Response**: Generated complete server.ts with all required patterns.


### Prompt 4: Final Documentation Check
```
Verify all required documentation exists and is accurate:
- README.md (comprehensive)
- PROMPTS.md (this file, all prompts used)
- Code comments (inline documentation)
```

**Response**: Confirmed all documentation is complete and accurate.

### AI Tools Used:
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Primary development assistant for all code generation, architecture design, and documentation

### Development Methodology:
1. **Research Phase**: Studied official Cloudflare Agents SDK documentation
2. **Initial Implementation**: Created basic structure
3. **Correction Phase**: Realized initial approach didn't match official patterns, completely rewrote to follow SDK exactly
4. **Feature Development**: Added tools, state management, SQL database
5. **UI Development**: Built React interface with official hooks
6. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test scenarios
7. **Documentation**: Wrote extensive docs at multiple levels
8. **Polish**: Enhanced accessibility, responsiveness, error handling
9. **Verification**: Final review against assignment requirements

### Key Learning:
The most important insight was recognizing the need to follow **official SDK patterns exactly** rather than implementing custom solutions. After reviewing the official agents-starter template, I rewrote significant portions to use:
- `createDataStreamResponse` instead of direct streaming
- `agentContext.run()` for proper async handling
- `processToolCalls` for tool confirmation workflow
- Official React hooks (`useAgent`, `useChat`)
- Proper `executions` object pattern

This resulted in a more maintainable, idiomatic implementation that follows Cloudflare's best practices.
